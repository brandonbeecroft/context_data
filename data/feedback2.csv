- Copyright infringement when being unable to limit access and use.
- Inability to monetize certifications because they are technically available to any 
  corporation with a manager to assign on the author screen.
- Inability to separate sub accounts allowing course materials to stay separate and avoid 
  confusion when courses are duplicated and tweaked to meet the needs of separate 
  corporations.

tdelude@instructure.com,Brewer Science,Employee Development,,Courses,Author,"Medium - The problem is causing pain for the client, but they are able to work around it","We have several courses that recur annually. The current expire/re-enroll tool is based on the last time the learner completed the course. For example, if a training was assigned company-wide on June 1 and employees have 30 days to complete, then the next year, it will assign for those employees on different dates depending on when they completed. We typically allow 30 days so most of them will get a redeployment sometime in May or June to keep them in compliance. If someone is out on FMLA leave or a new employee starts in say, September, those people are then off-cycle. Because of the rolling deployment based on the completion date, everyone else also starts to be staggered. Eventually, everyone is different. 

This makes it difficult to monitor when courses will be deployed, which prevents us from staggering them so that some employees don't get overburdened at any one time. It also makes pushing updates to these courses difficult because it seems like someone is always actively enrolled in the courses.

What we would really like is the ability to say, ""Training X is always due on June 30"" instead of just scheduling them all for 30 day completion from the time of enrollment.",,"This would help companies maintain compliance and not require authors/admins to re-create courses with a unique enrollment date, which makes completion tracking through the years a challenge",No,,,

Also, when I or any manager pull a report the status for live trainings, courses and checkpoints is âIn Progressâ when an item hasnât been completed, which isnât helpful.

With BrainShark and Talent LMS, we can at least send them a link directly to the training without them getting stuck at the login (although they still have to provide info via a guestbook and it is not connected to SF).

As you recall, we use the single sign-on via SF communities to automatically provision them a license to get into Bridge. If I send them a link to the Bridge course, they get stuck at the Bridge login. I can send them a link to the partner portal and write the instructions on how to get to Training but Iâve been told that it is too many steps to get to the training.

Because we donât usually know who the individual partner contact is ahead of time, we donât have a way to easily provision them a license in Bridge without directing them to the portal first. Being one of dozens of other vendors means that if it isnât easy to access, the partner simply wonât do it. Thatâs where we are today so Iâve had to resort to a stop-gap solution called JotForm where I can at least provide videos and knowledge check questions via a link and collect their info via a guestbook.

It seems like Bridge is better suited for talent management instead of channel partner training. If there is a solution that Iâm missing, Iâm willing to sit down with one of your colleagues but if we canât find a good way to provide ungated access, then weâll have to pursue another solution at the end of our contract term.
