Aware Recovery Care,Goals,"Couple of problems that are stopping them from using goals: 1) Their company goals are actually OKRs so there's about two sentences worth of information for each OKR. The format of company goals doesn't allow for spacing or additional info and doesn't display all 1,000 characters in the little box, so company goals can't be utilized by Aware Recovery Care. They have company goals though, so they are disappointed that they can't be displayed as needed.","They work hard to create company OKRs and it is a norm in this company that individual and team goals should contribute/align to OKRs. Leadership cares most about these OKRs and goals (they want to check in on it frequently) and since goals doesn't meet this need and Aware Recovery Care doesn't feel they can use company goals at all,  they may lose executive support for this software as a result. ",
Aware Recovery Care,Goals,"2) UI does not show full picture of goal alignment data, only individual goals aligned to company goals. While the new data export on goals does show this data, it isn't in the UI where they want to access it easily and show their leadership at any time without a lot of manual work to pull the CSV and build visuals from that data manually.","They work hard to create company OKRs and it is a norm in this company that individual and team goals should contribute/align to OKRs.

",
Aware Recovery Care,Goals,"3)Goals aren't visible to an entire reporting line/department, only between manager and direct reports. They want to set one departmental goal rather than ask every manager to repeat the same goal and potentially lose the message like a game of telephone.","They work hard to create company OKRs and it is a norm in this company that individual and team goals should contribute/align to OKRs.

Meet Me In The Cloud,Courses,"The users wants to be able to embed SCORM/HTML5 packages into courses with Bridge content, not upload them as separate courses. Donna said, ""it’s really about being able to add an interactive piece within a Course, so I can keep my file sizes small and easily interchangeable/updatable, plus take advantage of the other features within Bridge. Having to create each as a separate Course and put them within a Program is just an awful solution which takes away the nice learning flow of a single course.""","This would make authoring/updating SCORM/HTML5 content in Bridge way easier and more seamless.

Empire Today,Career,Cannot see drivers that an individual entered onto Bridge without masquerading. Process is very manual and slow and they'd prefer to have a report on it. ,"Empire is experiencing turnover in the sales department. Their sales reps and managers are both having higher than desired turnover and through their own digging, Empire found correlations between managers' top drivers and their team's engagement scores (used an NPS survey tool to gather this data). They would like to take this information and use it to influence hiring decisions and manager training initiatives, but the process for pulling drivers information is so painstaking that it turns them off to this project. Having a report on drivers would make this type of data exploration faster and easier to help Empire address attrition problems faster. ",We are not focusing on Career at the moment
Heinemann ,Connect/Directory,"Currently there is no way to control visibility on your email address being displayed in Connect.  Even if the email was only visible to managers and admin, that would be fine with yet another option to have individual users control the visibility (similar to how we can control phone number) ","Heinemann is a retail business and the majority of their employees have a non @heinneman email. As such, these employees' personal emails are being pulled into Bridge and displayed in the Directory. Heinnemann is worried that this could be a Privacy issue as anyone in the company has visibility into someone's personal email address.  The admin is worried that if someone complained about it, they would end up shutting down Bridge. He does not want to turn off connect as the skill communities are still valuable to them. Getting company emails (O365) for the retail employees is very costly and they are at least a year out from even going that route as a business.",https://instructure.atlassian.net/browse/BEAM-3268

AvidXchange,Insights,"AvidXchange would like to be able to send custom reports to people from Bridge. They want members of their sales team to see learn insights for the whole sales department, but not have admin access to anything else in Bridge. Currently, the workaround would require messing with the org chart and putting someone who isn't head of the sales department at the top so they could see manager insights. Rather than playing around with permissions where some people will see more insights than they want, they'd prefer to have the ability to send desired insights reports to specific people through Bridge. ",This would allow AvidXchange to give people lower on the totem pole the reports they need to do their jobs without giving them too much access on Bridge by messing around with permissions. ,

AvidXchange,Notifications,"Notifications from assessments are coming through as ""Bridge"" even with custom branding and custom to and from labels are set. These clients do not refer to Bridge as ""Bridge"" and seeing email notifications from Perform that refer to ""Bridge"" is confusing and frustrating to the clients. The core issue is that notifications from EmpDev modules do not have access to the same features as Learn. Please add the ability to customize from and reply labels for EmpDev emails as well as the ability to turn on/off emails from EmpDev modules. ","Continuity across the platform would help with adoption.

Vera Whole Health,Notifications,"Client would like the Manager Digest to include specific learner names. At this time, the notification indicates the number of overdue learners.

GoHealth,Checkpoints,"From GoHealth: Within the checkpoint, all the columns in the list of learners are not sortable. We want to keep track of which learner is pending approval to make sure our checkpoint approvers are approving in a timely manner. An easy way for me to do that would be to sort the learners based on the status of their checkpoint. Then, I am able to get a headcount of who is waiting for approval all at once instead of weeding through the hundreds of learners within the checkpoint. Another reason for columns to be sortable would be so we could see how many learners each approver has approved or rejected. Again, this would be another way we can easily track approvers’ performance.  Ideally, we want all this information in a report that can easily be pulled, but this could be an easy fix before we can get the report we want.

The reports that we can pull do not have all the information we need. Reports that can be exported from either a checkpoint or the insights section, and they do not have the date the checkpoint was approved nor the name/ID of the approver. We need this information to document for our records when certificates were approved in the checkpoint. Also, when pulling the report, the learner’s status is not as defined as it could be. On the list of leaners section, it shows the agent’s progress as open, completed, pending approval, and retry. We would really like to see this in the report as well. The progress status we really need is the retry status. The only way to find out which agents were denied approval is if you comb through the long list of learners in the checkpoint or if you pull a separate report in insights that only shows agents who “must retake” the checkpoint. BUT when you export this report within the deep dive, there is no status distinction between those who are overdue because they have not submitted for approval and those who are overdue because they were denied approval (“must retake”). This is time consuming because the filter options in the enrollment status section of the deep dive do not align with how that enrollment status is defined in the report that is pulled.","They are implementing and leaning heavily on the checkpoint feature in Bridge. Checkpoints are now used to track certifications their employees need to have in order to be appointed and sell with an insurance carrier. They believe Bridge is a great place to document this information and somewhere their Licensing Team can easily access these certificates and approve them, but they are having trouble pulling reports from both the checkpoint itself and the deep dive feature in Insights.

AvidXChange,Engage,"Couple of issues that led users to think the Engage email was phishing: 
1) The email doesn't come from avidxchange, it comes from reply@engage.bridgeapp.com. This is a regular issue with all things that aren't learn, that custom notifications don't apply and it's also causing an issue here.
2) The subject line can't be changed for the Engage email. In place of having a custom from label, they would have liked to change the subject from ""we want to hear from you!"" to ""a survey from AvidXChange learning"" so employees knew it was legit
3) the AvidXchange logo on the top left of the purple box with the survey header is grey, which I was told today is intentional. Grey on purple is faint and hard to see so it made the email look like a fake.

Transaction Data Systems,"Courses, Programs, Live Trainings, Insights, Admin Tools","Email from customer:
""The pain point would be in the lack of reporting for account admin/admins in a user friendly U/I solution. We should not be expected to look at the data dump reports. We know the data exists so why not make it visually and easier for a manager/account admin/admin to use?  

If the data is within the files there needs to be effort in prioritizing reports that can easily go into Insights for better usage. Our company goal is to give each employee a quarterly goal of 10 hours of coursework OR 40 hours annually. To try to achieve reporting on this is manual and gruesome. Therefore, my idea is to build a report based on the data that is already being recorded in the data dump.

Expectation:

Admins should expect to be able to look up any user within a timeframe to see how many hours completed for all courses, live programs, and all programs. Nice to have: users (end users) will be able to see their total time allocated to completed coursework on their completed learning dashboard based on a date range they can look at to ensure there are within their goal.  

Here would be the conditions:

By user, need a way to filter a time period of X to X (January 1 – January 31) up to a 18 month time frame (that way we reduce the amount of load pulling old data).
Need to pull in courses within the date timeframe given, that shows completed only (exclude in progress) for courses, live programs and programs the user has taken.
I need the report to pull user name, time in course/program, and duration of course/program (since we might use this instead if it’s more accurate) for only completed courses. 

Outcome:
 
If a user goes into Insights OR goes into user profiles one-by-one, they should be able to go to a user profile and pull up how many hours of coursework, live program, or program work that has been completed (exclude in progress) within a date time frame given by the user (up to 18 months at minimum).""",This would give a significant amount of time back to admins who are having to compile multiple reports from our data dump for a large number of users. ,

Altura,Courses,"""The current Bridge functionality is that a learner will be marked as ‘completed’ if they have failed all of the allotted attempts because technically, their enrollment is completed, as there is nothing left for the learner to complete or do in that course.

I've had a similar issue with clients where employees either filled out the survey and forgot or legitimately never got an email. As a result, some managers with teams of 5 or 6 aren't getting dashboards, not because employees voluntarily didn't fill out the survey, but because they never got the chance. I wish there was a way I could help them troubleshoot why surveys weren't filled out, but I don't have any visibility into the emails that were sent and/or completed.",More visibility into why completion scores may not be at 100%,
Southwest Tennessee Community College,Live Trainings,"They use Microsoft Teams for a web conference provider. In Live Trainings to add this video information they need to choose ""Other"" from the drop down list. Jennifer said, ""I was thinking since there is a link to create a web conference, that they can also provide option for teams. Right now we have to select other. The language is confusing for our users because they think they will have to download something if we use that option. If Teams is integrated the way the others are, the text would read join the meeting using Microsoft Teams rather than join the meeting using “Other”.""",It would provide clarity to the end users who think they need to download something in order to access the Live Training so the experience would be much more seamless. I have also gotten this feedback from the client Global Resources International. ,
Persado,Courses,The admin would like to be able to pull learner data by learner at the Course level. An example would be finding Jane Doe's quiz results for Course X. Right now they can only find by exporting larger reports and filtering by the individual. ,"The admin wouldn't have to export a report and filter through users in a CSV to find a specific user's score, so this would save them a lot of time. ",
Persado,Courses,"We have a value for each letter of our company and rather than doing a simple 'matching' which someone just needs to spell out the company name to get it correct, we are utilizing the 'Vocabulary' smart questions. So when we make the question, on the left side we put the value: People and the right the definition ""At Persado, our people are our most important asset.' When we cycle the type questions we get the attached. You'll notice the double period at the end as well as capitalization of 'at' where in this particular sentence, it shouldn't be unless there is a colon.  To avoid the double period, I removed it from the value in the answer. However, when I cycle through again, because I've removed the period, it now removes it from another type of question but the question is grammatically correct otherwise. 

While on this topic, it would be really great if we could get data by question. It would be great to see which version of each question is getting the most correct and the least so we know what information may need to be updated/remediated/etc. It can really help us hone in on learner knowledge.",We might need to reevaluate the different formats smart questions come in or at least give the clients more control over which possible questions cycle through so that they always appear grammatically correct unless the client makes a mistake. The other suggestion in this form is the option to show by question which format gets the most correct responses vs. incorrect. I think if this is shown in the UI that would be best rather than a report.,
Brewer Science,Courses,Courses must be uploaded to Bridge one at a time. Brewer Science gets 15+ new SCORM courses every month from a content provider. It take hours to upload them into Bridge and then add them to the Library. They would like to upload SCORM in bulk with a Category already assigned so that they can be added to the library. Some of the content that we receive monthly is an update to a course we currently have.,We are more or less looking for a work around to upload in bulk new content of the same category to streamline adding courses into Bridge. ,

SGWS,Admin Tools,"When uploading users into Bridge, be it user accounts, enrollments, or uploading to live training sessions, when the confirmation message comes up, it would be nice to get the email or UIDs of those users who ""will be ignored' so that the Admin can research the issues.

AvidXchange,Engage,"AvidXchange is currently setting up a test Engage Survey for a few departments. The survey is only open 5 business days and I suggested they go heavy on the reminders so that people who procrastinate on filling the survey out get a lot of opportunities to do so. They grimaced thinking of how the people least likely to take this particular survey are the heads of those test departments who are judging whether Engage is for them or not. They were thinking about how many emails the dept heads would get and how they'd feel spammed and it would look bad on Engage. So, to not upset the department heads, they limited email reminders, which in my opinion will hurt the majority of people who they're looking for feedback from. AvidXchange wishes there was a way to decide who within a survey group was exempt from receiving notifications.",,
AvidXchange,Engage,Would like the ability to copy surveys.,"They have a use case where they want to send the same survey to multiple groups. Some employees in the same department report to different managers and they don't want managers to see results for ""product marketing"" and not know if it's their employees or someone else's. Recreating the same survey twice is too manual and they'd like to be able to duplicate the survey.",
AvidXchange,Engage,"The final check before liftoff is confusing, specifically the wording around scheduling. They're creating a survey that's only going out to one department for now with no intention of repeating it at this time, so their cadence is one time, everyone 12 months, starting May 7th, open until May 11th, ending on May 12th.

Bridge Internal,Sub-Accounts,"It is hard to know if a sub-account is used for EE licenses or normal licensees. This came up as a customer is thinking about adding additional EE users to Bridge and I went to pull the users CSV to see how many accounts have already been used this contract year. Since I did not implement them and they have a few sub-accounts, I am not sure which ones count towards EE licenses or normal licenses. I am asking the Admin to confirm, but I imaging with the amount of admin turnover we see, this may not be something all admin would have the institutional knowledge to know.

Persado,Certificates,They want a better view of certificates. They want managers to be able to quickly see which direct reports have received certificates from both courses and programs. The only way to do this currently is the completed users report from the Insights page and that is specific to courses ONLY. ,"From the client***
I think if there was a hierarchy, it would be:
1) managers being able to see it on their insights page as a card. i.e certificates earned on team. much like they can see overdue learners or learner progress
2) a report by the team from the deep dive filters
3) by course and programs.

Seeing the certificates earned by course at the course level would for sure be at the bottom of the list as some managers have learners in multiple courses concurrently. This would mostly fit the process of 'who has earned a certificate from this course' rather than the overall 'what certificates has Rory earned this month'",
Precision Diagnostics,Learn Surveys,Admin want to be able to send a survey upon completion of each course and upon completion of each Live training,They wanted to use engage for this but that is not the use case so they are considering using another survey tool.

New managers at C Space want to see PCs from previous managers to know what went on and where they're picking up.

The concern is that HR Admin aren't able to address those moments when something serious may have been addressed in a PC and can't easily help managers get acquainted with their new teams.

Persado Inc.,Courses,"""When it comes to SCORM and Bridge developed content, manually adjusting the due date to 7 days isn't as much of an 'issue' as we adjust the due date based on the 'work order' submitted by our client and it's done on a 1:1 basis before we launch. However, with LiL there are literally thousands of courses that get pulled in through the API and we can't possibly monitor and change all of them. However, based on your suggestion we will export every single LiL course to a spreadsheet and send it back to you so that we can have that due date changed to 30 days. Admittedly, it would be a terrific update to the platform if the 'auto due date' could be adjusted. In truth, 7 days is quite aggressive even for the most compliant organizations.

Is this a feature that is being prioritize for future updates?  The managers having access to assign to their learners any course published within the main or sub accounts causes major problems on three levels when you have multiple corporations under a larger enterprise library in bridge:

- Copyright infringement when being unable to limit access and use.
- Inability to monetize certifications because they are technically available to any 
  corporation with a manager to assign on the author screen.
- Inability to separate sub accounts allowing course materials to stay separate and avoid 
  confusion when courses are duplicated and tweaked to meet the needs of separate 
  corporations.

American Express,User Enrollment,"Currently, Amex uses Bridge to educate sales partners on American Express and encourage them to sell it.

Lauren stated that if she had understood this limitation of Bridge they would not have signed their contract.

Amex purchased 10k, licenses expecting this program to take off.  They have seen just over 100 users enroll outside AMEX this year.  While we are working on their strategy (involving partners better, incentives for learners, growing audience/use of Bridge), this is reportedly a major roadblock for people signing up to take courses.  Our AMEX contact thinks users are not completing enrollment because of how long (and how many clicks) it takes.

Ideally, we could have a link where users could request an account or sign up on their own (example link here https://cl.ly/684d964bc228).

For Amex, they are “less concerned about people getting in that shouldn’t, and are more about accessibility”.  I have some ideas around how this could work from a security standpoint from other products/companies I’ve worked with- happy to discuss further.","Implementing this change could have major positive impact for all the organizations we work with.

Brewer Science,Courses,"We have several courses that recur annually. The current expire/re-enroll tool is based on the last time the learner completed the course. For example, if a training was assigned company-wide on June 1 and employees have 30 days to complete, then the next year, it will assign for those employees on different dates depending on when they completed. We typically allow 30 days so most of them will get a redeployment sometime in May or June to keep them in compliance. If someone is out on FMLA leave or a new employee starts in say, September, those people are then off-cycle. Because of the rolling deployment based on the completion date, everyone else also starts to be staggered. Eventually, everyone is different. 

This makes it difficult to monitor when courses will be deployed, which prevents us from staggering them so that some employees don't get overburdened at any one time. It also makes pushing updates to these courses difficult because it seems like someone is always actively enrolled in the courses.

What we would really like is the ability to say, ""Training X is always due on June 30"" instead of just scheduling them all for 30 day completion from the time of enrollment.","This would help companies maintain compliance and not require authors/admins to re-create courses with a unique enrollment date, which makes completion tracking through the years a challenge",

Ready,Engage,They would like a feature built into the UI that allows Managers to plan based on the outcomes of an Engagement survey. ,This feature would give admins insight into how teams and departments are addressing their survey results.,
Multiplex Australasia,Reporting,Client would like to see the Date from data data (the numbers cause them to have to manually change the information before submitting to their HRIS). Also would like Checkpoints and Live Trainings added to the Insights tab since they need to report off those components. ,Easier to navigate within Bridge before diving into Excel CSVs.,
Granite Construction,Insights,"As a manager of other managers, I have *no way* to see just my direct reports learners assignment status at all.  There is no clear way to get a snapshot of where just those 13 learners are....and I have to see 3K users data - every report I pull provides me data on users several layers down.  An Admin would have to create a special group for just me to have access to independent of the MyLearners group created.",I'd want to go to Bridge to look at reports and I'd have useful data at my fingertips. ,
Gaylor Electric,Live Trainings,Gaylor wants to be able to assign continuing education credits to a live training. ,"They could give CE credits for items that earn them at their org, lots of which are live events. ",
Movement Mortgage,Courses,They'd like the ability to add a data field that would allow them to manually track a date that they followed up with an overdue learner.,"This allows for the organization to pull reports of training due date, status and any applicable follow up dates.",
Altec Industries,certifications,Certifications do not display any more info than course name and completions date.  Altec needs CEU credits (or even course duration) for their business to show proof of taking certain compliance course for auditors as they. are in manufacturing and safety is paramount.,"This would help with any Audit for employees to prove they've taken certain courses. While the ability for a user to. print. up their own transcript with this info will work, the certification would be ideal.  May other clients would like room to put more details into the cert. Including BCFS for auditing. ",
RMIT,Certifications ,RMIT needs more customization in their course and Live Training certificates - they need the expiration date to be exposed on it including other dates. ,The expiry will be needed for some of their compliance courses.  ,
Vivint,Admin Tools,"Vivint runs into the 20% deletion issue frequently with seasonal sales staff. They would like to be able to edit/customize the % at which this error appears. Also, they would like a notification trigger when this error does appear.",Save the admin team a lot of time on monitoring this issue while also not interrupting new hires from taking mandatory compliance training needed before selling.,
Embrace Home Loans,Checkpoints,"Because we do not have notifications when a course is complete, this client uses Checkpoints to notify admin when users have completed courses. Currently one of the Admins has 200 checkpoints to approve. He would love is checkpoints had an ""Approve All"" button",It would make the approval process much faster for them instead of having to individually approve each checkpoint. ,

RigUp,Journeys,Customer very interested in Programs within Programs,Better training paths for employees. ,
RigUp,Courses,"Customer would love to see recommended courses/programs based on comprehension/categories/completion score. For example, anyone that gets under 70% on a course/skill is this auto enrolled or recommended to courses to improve that skill. So it auto triggers new courses for them to take and it auto assigns those courses depending on a learners knowledge/score. Customer has asked Lessonly in the past as well - knows it's not easy to do, but thinks it would set an LMS apart.",Better learning path for learners. More automated and tailored learning experience. ,
Altura,Reporting,Time Stamps are not included in the Completed Learner Report,"UK law has recently begun to crack down on tracking of hourly employee wages in HealthCare space (Altura's primary market), and not having this data included in the completed learner report is causing additional administrative burden to join multiple reports. 
With much of Altura's content being VIDEO, our accuracy of that data is also problematic (cust feedback line 24) with relation to this need",
ARCO Business Services,User Interface,"Customer would like the option to easily enroll learners through the UI based on hire dates/how long someone has been in a company position. For example, ""If there was a less or greater than “X Date”, that would be extremely beneficial.""",Help client more easily enroll learners based on their tenure.,
Capco LLC,Courses,They do not want to set a number of days for when a course renews. Instead they would like to just set an actual date that courses renew.,This is something they need to align with their government contracts. ,
Colorado State University - Bridge,Programs,Ability to re-enroll user in a completed Program.,Ability to send training to users again without using the auto re-enroll/expire feature (one off user needing to re-take the Program). Removes the need to create the same program to then enroll the user. ,
Enerbank USA,Reporting,"""We have all of our clients spread out over about 60 subaccounts (based on their business)—and its nearly impossible to get completion reports at a global level. We developed a script that downloads all of the data from bridge and identifies completion, but it is very cumbersome and a highly manual process. I would think an enterprise level LMS would have more robust native reporting functionality—it seems like all of the updates are UX/UI or new features, and not building out the basics of an LMS. Can you point me in the right direction? Is Bridge going to continue to be supported and be a future leader in business LMS’s? As it looks today, its having a hard time competing with other enterprise systems.""",More robust reporting for their accounts with completion reports. ,
C Space,1on1s - Performance Conversations,"C Space doesn't want to use PCs because they don't do scheduling all at the same time, but they'd like to see the collection of PCs regardless, so scheduling being the only way to see that data is a sticking place for them. ",More autonomy for HR and more help from Bridge to catch concerning things quickly.,
C Space,1on1s - Performance Conversations,There isn't enough easily visibility into PCs from an HR admin perspective. Going into the data export to get PC details isn't helpful or easy and the only way to grab old PCs now is by masquerading as downloading it. HR would like to more autonomously audit PCs for info they need to address rather than only going to search for PCs if they're notified of something concerning. ,More autonomy for HR and more help from Bridge to catch concerning things quickly.,
Brewer Science,Live Trainings,Admin would like to be able to Archive Live Trainings. ,"They sometimes ""retire"" a training blue print (they're no longer offering this course) and they don't want another Author to schedule a session, but they also don't want to only have access to the data via Data Dump.",

TCF/Chemical Bank,Live Trainings,Ability to register for more than 1 session of a live training at a time,Unsure of the why behind it (came from a support chat interaction) but wanted to log it. ,
Ronald Blue,Courses,They are asking for the ability to have half CE credits be accepted ,"Right now, Bridge only accepts full numbers but they have a number of half credit courses. Currently, the only option is to use a tag or put the CU amount in the course title. Neither really work well. ",
Bridge for Bridge,Timeline,"Creating a culture of recognition. It would be neat if when an Bridge employee is mentioned in bridge_gush (or any Slack channel used for employee recognition) that shoutout is added on the employees History/Timeline.

Cotiviti,Customization,"They ability to roll down branding changes from the Root to all sub-accounts in one motion. Currently, customer has to go in sub by sub and update any branding changes.  They were recently acquired, so this is now a very manual process. ","Manually copying down branding into Client sites, or Orgs within a business at scale is incredibly time consuming. Even small iterative changes, like colors-schemes, which would be more common than an acquisition, can be laborious. ",
Health Catalyst,Customization,"""Are we able to add a custom field to our Programs and Courses? We have a course measure/descriptor that we would like to track for each module. We would use the credit hours field, but the measure is not a whole number."" ","Allow for customization of the course/program fields. For example, having 1.5 credit hours (it only accepts whole numbers).",
HelloFresh Canada,Goals,"Managers want to use team goals to set OKRs for everyone. If the team goals section had even a notes box, that would be better than just the title and aligning it to a company goal. My workaround was to create an individual goal and assign it to all team members, but I know from past experiences with other clients that when manager turnover happens or the manager leaves, goals set by the manager and not the individual become locked so this will become an issue down the road. ",Managers could actually use the goals section rather than hacking it or not using it at all. ,
ARCO Business Services / Arco Construction,Courses,Tags flowing to subaccounts,From customer: This is extremely troubling and the fact that you can only upload one at a time exacerbates the time to retag every item in each subaccount. This does not seem like a sustainable model to attract new clients that have a lot of courses to transfer over…,
Symphony ,1on1s - Performance Conversations,Need for Ratings in the PC (both self and manager ratings),"They incorporate ratings into their PC. Emp and Mgr rate and then the rating is either ""approved"" and locked in or needs to be adjusted before finalizing/closing the PC. ",

Symphony ,Goals,"Ability to ""lock"" goals down and prevent changes/edits to the goal until they are set again (every 6months)",This better fits their current process and they dont wish to disrupt that too much. ,
ALL Clients,Courses,"The default of 7 days due for courses being ON leaves room for mistakes, and clients often want a very different default than 7.","It would honor the client culture and allow for them to determine the default standard for their own org, perhaps even leaving it off. A systems setting for them to determine the default would help all clients to determine their own best practices. ",
Symphony ,Goals,ability to set department level goals,"They currently set goals at the org, department, team and individual level. So in moving to Bridge, they are losing the ability to set department wide goals",
Ronald Blue,Goals,Smart groups based on new hire date. We would have to assign to all learners now and mark everyone complete OR they would have to manually manage a New Hire Y/N in the csv.,This often comes up when going through implementation that they want to assign new hire learning to everyone from this point in time going forward but not to current employees. We have workaround but they can be annoying for the client,
HelloFresh Canada,Goals,"Everything about Goals feels like it's not what they expected or was sold because it ""just doesn't work."" They launched first to their leadership who wanted to jump into goals and were immediately disappointed making it difficult for the L&D team to ""sell Bridge and get adoption for the tool."" Specifics:
1. ""Everyone"" in visibility is misleading and doesn't do anything
2. Leaders can't see goals downstream in their department, can only see goals of their own direct reports
3. Reporting doesn't show alignment to team goals and team goal alignment to company goals",They are very goals focused and want to use this to help keep their org on task,
Pinsent Masons,Reporting,"It is difficult to easily pull a report on which users have completed a course, when and what the course was. This information is not available in Insights and requires the Pinsent Masons to download all data and merge different spreadsheets together and create pivot tables. This is all very time consuming and combersome for the Pinsent Masons.

Plus, it will help them manager user's learning more effectively.",
HelloFresh Canada,Reporting,"They want to see on the UI a report of who logged in and when. They don't want to have to go to the data export to collect this info.

Trendiction S.A.,Skills Assessments,Trendiction S.A would like to be able to segment skills feedback data by country and department.,"This would create more context to the feedback provided to an individual as what they might do well with one department, the same skill may not be working for a different department.
