HISTORICAL NOTES:


* Carolyn has only been with Bridge for last 16 months since she’s been with Phocas
* First time they’ve had a head of L&D
   * Carolyn has been in L&D for 17 years
* Bridge was perfect for Phocas for number of years because there was no real L&D team
* HR partner looked after it
* 300 people (will stay there for a number of years)
   * Global offices that are evenly spread
   * Hybrid workers and fully remote
* Challenges with logging in (SSO)
   * Microsoft365
   * Would work sometimes and not others
   * Had to use incognito to login
   * Had to log out of Microsoft365 and then log back in
* “No one will leave Bridge saying that it was terrible”
* Beyond onboarding, people then wouldn’t go back to it very often
* No champion
* Low engagement and felt like a legacy platform, so Carolyn struggled to feel like she could press forward with it
* Carolyn tried to revive it, but there were frustrations around it
   * Support responses often felt like, “No we won’t do that and we can’t do that”
* Started researching mid-last year
   * Went with Learn Amp (UK-based and relatively new, 7-8 years)
      * More advanced in social learning space
      * Bridge feels too static and Learm Amp feels more involved in product roadmap and that they are more involved in development conversations
* Carolyn did her own onboarding through Bridge
   * Quality of content wasn’t great (not Bridge’s fault)
* She was pretty alone in her learning of Bridge
   * Would have appreciated a direct person to speak to
   * Didn’t feel like she had partnership with Bridge; just ask and receive
* Learn Amp is doing an 8-week implementation with an implementation partner
   * Meet for an hour every Monday
   * Once launched, Carolyn will go to customer success team to have a contact
      * “Knowing someone personally helps tremendously”
* Using mostly internally
* Use lightly a sub-account for consultants
   * Considering doing the same thing in Learn Amp, which would push user count up significantly
      * Knew they could do this in Bridge, but they already made the choice for Learn Amp, they had already 
* Tried to integrate Bridge with Go1
   * Janky IT work to get this to go through
   * Not smooth at all and not everything would come through (i.e. course images)
   * 30k courses in Bridge
      * Incredibly slow
      * Not clean to manage
* Direct integration with Learn Amp and Go1 (didn’t even have to build anything)
* Also use Articulate360 and Rise
   * Carolyn was supposed to have a team to do authoring, but right now it’s just her with the state of the economy
   * Limited on time to build content
* Learn Amp can sign up for training through Journey
   * Zoom integration that can run through platform
      * User joins and launches within Learn Amp
      * Session can be saved and added as a learnable right after recording
* Onboarding is currently a Journey
   * Functionality is great for user
   * Visibility of it is really hard
      * Had to have the exact permissions to see what’s in it or be the user
* Seems like there’s limited access to do things in bulk (i.e. upload courses, archive courses)
* Learn Amp integrates with Namely (HR Platform)
   * IT tried to build this out for them in Bridge
      * New user would get created, but admins had to go in and manually do everything
   * Tried autoCSV and didn’t work (not sure how much that was tested)
* “It’s been a good product for us up until this point”
* It feels like Bridge is just completely stalled on product development
   * Did not even know we had Perform
* Not moving anything historical to Learn Amp


USE CASES:


* Internal onboarding
USAGE LAST 365 DAYS:


  

EFFORTS & THOUGHTS:


* Shared that we do have performance software if they are ever interested in a tool
* Customers may be in “BST” but they don’t seem to really understand that they have another point of contact other than support
   * Even if they did, this feels confusing and disjointed
      * “Reach out to this person to do this, but then reach out to this person to do this”
* We could have certainly serviced their external training use case
   * How are we marketing this to our existing base of internal use cases?
* Can we leverage Pendo when new admins are added to get them into the appropriate training or give them a moment of human contact to meet someone?
